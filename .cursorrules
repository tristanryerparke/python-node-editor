1. I'm building a node editing tool in with python backend and react typescript frontend.
2. There is heavy emphasis on the use of pydantic V2 in the backend.
3. for the frontend I use bun, vite and tailwindcss, as well as mantine for much of the ui.
4. Since Tailwind scans your source files as plain text, it has no way of understanding string concatenation or interpolation in the programming language you're using
5. Do not launch the frontend or the backend from tools, as I usually already have them running.
